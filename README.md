## üîÅ Queue Logic Explained

> Notes are first stored locally and then pushed to Firestore using a custom in-memory queue.

- Notes are marked `isUploaded = false` initially
- A Dart `Timer.periodic()` checks the queue every 5 seconds
- If internet is available and user is logged in, notes are pushed to Firestore
- After upload, `isUploaded` is marked `true` locally
- BLoC is triggered to refresh UI (`GetNotesEvent`)

## üîê Authentication

- Firebase Auth Email/Password Login
- Logged-in user‚Äôs email is shown in Dashboard
- Notes are synced user-wise (based on UID/email)
